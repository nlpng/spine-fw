# spine-fw
This is a replicated mbed firmware for Ben Katz's [SPIne](https://github.com/bgkatz/SPIne) hardware.

The [original firmware](https://os.mbed.com/users/benkatz/code/SPIne/) is re-written with mbed-os 6.15.1. 
A personal project to experiment with mbed's eventqueue API functions, handles SPI and CAN interfaces.
